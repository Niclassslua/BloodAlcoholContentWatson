# BloodAlcoholContentWatson

**The task was as follows:**

*The blood alcohol content (BAC) is a measure for the amount of alcohol in the blood and is usually in parts by weight as g/kg (per mille). There are different ways of expressing the BAC as a function of gender, height, age weight, etc., which can be found on the Wikipedia page "Blood alcohol content" in the section "Estimation by intake".*

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content)

**a)** *Create a program "BloodAlcoholContent" to calculate the BAC according to Widmark's formula
by querying the relevant influencing factors and assuming a reduction factor (the rate at which alcohol is metabolized) of 0.7% or 0.6%.*

(Solved in https://github.com/Niclassslua/BloodAlcoholContent)

**b)** *Create another program "BloodAlcoholContentWatson" to complement your calculation from task a) by calculating the reduction factor according to the Watson formula. Follow exactly to the specifications on the wiki page! Choose suitable variable names!*
